            “After you kids came along, your mom, she said something to me I never quite understood. She said, "Now, we're just here to be memories for our kids." I think now I understand what she meant. Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.”

        Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is only one way to ensure mankind's
        survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team
        of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human
        life.—ahmetkozan
